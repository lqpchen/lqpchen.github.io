            Hi! I'm Peter Chen, born and raised in Shanghai, China, where I spent almost my entire life, until five years ago I moved to Auckland, New Zealand for my master's degree in Statistics. Now I'm working as a Data Scientist in Auckland full time and just got my permanent residence visa so that I can travel across the border any time.

            I'm also doing another degree in Computer Science in UIUC at the same time, since I want to dig deeper into how computers and cloud computing works and also broaden my horizon. 
          </p>

            When I'm not working or studying, I usually go to gym to do weight lifting or watch random Youtube videos. Sometimes, I also do random things such as learning Japanese, singing, cooking, doing research around exterrestrial lifes and mindfulness, etc, depending on how much free time I have. Recently, I become interested in learning more about web development and stock trading as a hobby.
